  "description": "Acer palmatumJapanese maple. To quote from Wikipedia: \"Even in nature, Acer palmatum displays considerable genetic variation, with seedlings from the same parent tree typically showing differences in such traits as leaf size, shape, and color.\" Thus, I'm at sea when it comes to assigning a cultivar name to this specimen.  The twig was taken from a tree in a private garden in Berkeley, CA",
