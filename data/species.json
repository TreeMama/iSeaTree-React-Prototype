    "DESCRIPTION": "Acer nigrum, the black maple, is a species of maple closely related to A. saccharum (Sugar Maple), and treated by some authors as a subspecies of it. Identification can be confusing due to the tendency of the two species to form hybrids. The simplest and most accurate method for distinguishing between the two trees is the generally three-lobed leaves of the black maple versus the generally five-lobed leaves of the sugar maple. The leaves of the black maple also tend to have a drooping appearance. Other differences that are not as pronounced include darker, more deeply grooved bark, slightly smaller seeds, a downy underside, and thicker petioles.",

It forms a dense and asymmetrical crown that starts at a height of  6–10 ft (approx. 2-3 m) and spreads widely in free-standing trees. The crown can be divided into several separate, rounded partial crowns. The young twigs are densely hairy light gray or whitish. Older branches are strong and knotty. The thick, longitudinally cracked cork layers of the gray-brown trunk bark are characteristic of the cork oak. The light and spongy cork fabric shows vertical cracks and is white on the outside and red to red-brown on the inside. Its leathery leaves are alternate and are 1 to 4 (2.5 to 10 cm) long and 1⁄2 to 2+1⁄2 in (1.2 to 6.5 cm) wide.",

Each individual type of acacia usually only has flowers in one specific color. Also, the shape of the leaves is typically unique to each Acacia species. The seeds for this species have various shapes and colors, but are all stored in a similar 'peapod-like' pod sack.",
