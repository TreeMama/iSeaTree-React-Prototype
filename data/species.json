This tree is a large evergreen which grows to mature heights of 165 feet (50+ m) or more. It has a globose, conical crown. Bark is smooth, furrowed only at the base, and can become scaly with age. The Pacific Silver Fir has needles similar to Grand Fir, dark green on top with white lines underneath. But the needles are shorter and point forward and upward rather than lying flat like Grand Fir needles. This gives each twig an appearance similar to hairs growing on a dog's tail.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Abies grandis is a fir native to the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. It occurrs at altitudes of sea level to 1,800 m. It is also a major constituent of the Grand Fir/Douglas Fir Ecoregion of the Cascade Range. In appearance, it looks very similar to the Pacific Silver Fir (Abies amabilis), except it tends to grow taller (260 ft vs 160 ft) and prefers drier climates. Unlike the Pacific Coast Fir it can also be found further inland from the coast (though it does occur with some frequency near to the coast). To distinguish the two species from each other, compare the bark (Grand Fir is more of a grayish-red brown color, whereas Pacific Fir tends to be more of a silver-grey brown color). Also the needle arrangements are different. The needles on the Grand Fir form flattened parallel sprays that show both the upper and lower surfaces of each twig. Each needle pair lies parallel to each other, and almost directly perpendicular from the branch. The Pacific Silver Fir needles look more bushy. With the Pacific Silver Fir needles point forward and upward - and look very similar to the hairs on a dog's tail.",

It earned its name because it is the largest native fir in North America. In its native habitat it grows 180-270 feet (54.8-82.2 meters) tall. This tall narrow tree features a long, columnar trunk and conical crown with short, nearly horizontal branches. It's easy to identify noble fir by looking at the underside of a twig. The needles are shaped like hockey sticks, and sweep away from the twig uniformly, giving them a combed appearance.",

The 'Trident Maple' grows to a height of 20–35 feet (6-10.6 meters) and a spread of 20–30 feet (6-9 meters) at maturity. This tree features distinctive, 3-lobed leaves that are 2–4 inches (5-10.16 cm) long and closely resemble a trident. This tree tends to grow as a multi-stemmed, low-branching specimen, but it can be pruned to a single stem. The exfoliating bark reveals an orange-brown inner bark, which adds interest. The fall color can be variable, sometimes yellows but usually reds and oranges.",

One version of these leaves are cordate (i.e. heart-shaped) with a serrated margin. Another version is deeply lobed - and also with serrated margins. The fruit has a collective of clusters and turns from pink to red while ripening, then dark purple or black, and has a sweet flavor when fully ripe.",

The leaves of the black maple also tend to have a drooping appearance. Other differences that are not as pronounced include darker, more deeply grooved bark, slightly smaller seeds, a downy underside, and thicker petioles.",

It was introduced to North America in the mid-1700s as a shade tree, and was widely planted as a street tree in the mid-20th century to replace elms destroyed by the Dutch elm disease. It is a large deciduous tree, often over 40 ft (approx. 12 m) at maturity with a broad crown. Leaves have five sharply pointed lobes, and are about 4-7 inches (10-18 cm) in length and width. Of the native maples, Norway maple is most similar in appearance to the Sugar maple. It can be distinguished from the Sugar Maple by the milky white sap that appears at the base of the leaf stems when the leaves are pulled from their branches. Native maple species have clear sap. The winged seeds (samaras) of the Norway maple are also somewhat larger than those of native species.",

In April, prior to the trees leafing out, a series of small yelow-green flowers develop. When the leaves appear they have 5 to 7 lobes that unfurl in the spring with a brown-red tinge. As the leaves mature they become a deep green color which turns into yellow in the fall.",

Simple leaves are also occasionally present; technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves. It features yellow-green flowers that are small and appear in early spring. In the fall, leaves are typically yellow with red stalks. The boxelder maple has lumber that is distinctly lighter then other maples, and its brown bark trunk (particularly when wet) gives off a foul, and unusual smell.",

Arbutus unedo is also commonly used in landscaping in California, where the Pacific Madrone is harder to cultivate. Arbutus unedo prefers cliff edges if it can get them.

It should be noted that the Incense cedar is NOT a true cedar (i.e. genus Cedrus), and is actually a member of the cypress family (Cupressaceae). The foliage in this tree is flattened sprays with scale-like leaves 0.08 to 0.6 inches (2–15 millimeters) long.  They are arranged in opposing decussate pairs, with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced, so forming apparent whorls of four; the facial pairs are flat, with the lateral pairs folded over their bases. Before opening, the small hanging female cones have ends that are tapered into a hook-shape. This tree is the preferred host of a Wood Wasp, Syntexis libocedrii a living fossil species which lays its eggs in the smoldering wood immediately after a forest fire. The tree is also host to Incense-Cedar Mistletoe (Phoradendron libocedri), a parasitic plant which can often be found hanging from its branches.",

Even though it is sometimes referred to as the 'Yellow Cedar' - it is neither yellow or a cedar. In its native habitat, this tree is most likely to be confused with Thuja plicata (Western Red Cedar). However, the mature trees are easily distinguished by their bark - the Western Red Cedar has more of a red-grey bark, while the Yellow Cedar is mostly white-grey. The female cones are also distinctly different- with the Western Red Cedar having a more open oval shape and the Yellow Cedar having a more tightly round - globose - shape with a hooked end.",

It can be found growing to 66 ft (20 m) tall, with exceptional heights around 130-160 ft (40–50 m), with a trunk DBH up to 3 ft 3 in (1 m) thick. The leaves are single on a twig, and flat and needle-like. They are up to 3/4 of an inch (2 cm) in length. They have a glaucous green above with a broad stripe of stomata, and two blue-white stomatal bands below. They are arranged as a whorl on the shoot, but with the leaf bases twisted to be arranged to the sides of and above the shoot, with few or none below the shoot. The cones are 2 1/4- 4 3/4 inches (6–12 cm) long, and dark purple or yellow-brown in color.",

It is also the tallest known eastern hardwood in North America, known for reaching heights of 191.8 feet (58.49 meters). The Tulip Tree is easy to remember for its leaves, which are shaped roughly like tulip flowers with rounded bases and square-lobed tops. The flowers have a more limited color range then magnolia trees, and are either pale green or yellow (rarely white). Leaves are slightly smaller in the American Tulip Tree when compared to the Asiatic species in this genus - the Chinese Tulip Tree (L. chinense). However there is still considerable overlap between the two species, and they easily hybridize easily. The bark on younger trees starts out as smooth, and dark green in color. As it ages it develops wide, white plates which eventually form into seperate flat ridges.",

The flowers can be seen emerging around mid-July. The buds are smooth and dark brown, and the fruit of the tree is a legume. The bark of the tree is described by some as 'zombie skin' because of its amber color, peeling texture, and green undertones. Amur Maackia is able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria from the Bradyrhizobium genus. Nodules form on the tree’s roots where the bacteria have penetrated through the root hairs into the main root.",

The leaves are simple, alternate, usually lanceolate, unlobed, and often with nectaries on the leaf stalk along with stipules. The flowers are usually white to pink, sometimes red, with five petals and five sepals. The fruit is a fleshy drupe (a prune) with a single relatively large, hard-coated seed (a stone).",

A few other oaks have bark with this kind of appearance in the upper tree, but the 'Northern Red Oak' is the only tree with the striping all the way down the trunk. The leaves are seven to nine-lobed - 5 to 10 inches long (12.7 - 25.4 cm), and 4 to 6 inches broad (10.16 - 15.24 cm). The ends of the leaf terminate with long bristle-pointed teeth.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Sequoiadendron giganteum (Giant Sequoia) is also known as: Giant Redwood, Sierra Redwood, Sierran Redwood, and Wellingtonia. It has also been called simply 'Big Tree' — a nickname which was used by the conservationist John Muir. It is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as Redwoods, classified in the family Cupressaceae with the Sequoia Sempervirens (Coast Redwood) and Metasequoia Glyptostroboides (Dawn Redwood). Giant sequoia specimens are some of the most massive trees on Earth, grow 250 to 300 feet (76 - 91.44 m) in the wild. An etymological study published in 2012 concluded that an Austrian writer, Stephen L. Endlicher, originated the genus name. A linguist and botanist, Endlicher corresponded with experts in the Cherokee language including Sequoyah, who was a Native American polymath from the Cherokee Nation, and is also credited as the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary. Endlicher realized that - coincidentally - the genus could be described in Latin as 'sequi' (meaning 'to follow') because the number of seeds per cone in the newly classified genus aligned in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder. Endlicher thus coined the name 'Sequoia' as both a description of the tree's genus and an honor to the indigenous man he admired. Giant sequoias are among the oldest living organisms on Earth, and are the verified third longest-lived tree species after the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine and Alerce. The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200–3,266 years old based on dendrochronology.",

Its common name is Western Red Cedar, but it is also called Pacific Red Cedar and Western Arborvitae. The latin term 'plicata' means 'folded' and this refers to the folding of the lateral scale leaves around the base of the facial scale leaves - which in some ways resemble origami folds. Another distinguishing feature are the white markings ('butterfly' pattern) that can be occasionally seen on the underside of the leaf spray. Cones are also a good clue, the Western Red Cedar female cones are .31-.39 inches (8-10mm) long and slightly oval in shape with a woody texture. They occur in clusters, and are carried usually upright on the lower branches of the tree. The Western Red Cedar has been called the 'corner stone of northwest coast Indian culture'. Its wood is easily split and rot resistant and was used to make important cultural items including, dugout canoes, paddles, house planks, baskets, spears, arrow shafts, and many other implements. The bark was stripped and dried from in the spring for making baskets, ropes, and mates. Red Cedar was considered an excellent fuel - especially for drying fish - because it burns with little smoke.",

Six of the species (Adansonia grandidieri, A. madagascariensis, A. perrieri, A. rubrostipa, A. suarezensis, and A. za) are endemic to Madagascar. The other two species come from mainland Africa/Arabian penninsula, and northwest Australia. Some of the species (such as the Adansonia suarezensis or Suarez baobab) are becoming increasingly rare due to habitat loss. Previously, the 'Baobab' was classified within the family Bombacaceae - which is a widely distributed family of tropical trees. Currently, they are now placed in the Malvaceae family - which is is a family of flowering plants (with a few trees) - which is estimated to contain around 4,225 known species. The 'Baobab' is frequently known as the 'tree of life' or as the 'upside down tree'. They rank as some of the most long-lived of vascular plants in the world, and have large flowers that are reproductive for a maximum of 15 hours. Trees within this genus are easy to identify due to their unusual barrel-like trunks and sparse - often rounded - crowns. It is also notable that many species in this genus have edible leaves and fruits - and some are important sources of herbal remedies.",

It is native to Latin America and the Caribbean, with one species (Vasey's Wild Lime i.e. Adelia vasey) extending northward into the southernmost part of Texas. Plants of this genus also occur naturally throughout Central and Southern Florida. There are individual species in this shrubby genus that actually grow to be very tall - even upwards to 13.7 ft (4.2 m). Species in the 'Wild lime' genus bloom year-round, with peak flowering occuring in winter and spring. Its dense foliage provides cover, and food, for many birds and small wildlife. Also, this genus of tree is a noted foodplant for many butterflies- including the Giant Swallowtail, one of the largest known butterflies. Despite its common name, 'Wild lime' is merely a cousin of culinary limes and other citrus fruit. However ,it is worth noting that 'Wild lime' flowers and crushed leaves really do smell distinctively like lime. Another notable trait about the species in this genus is that they have trunks and branches armed with sharp hooked thorns.",

It is native to the Central Coast of California and Mexico, and features upward pointing branches and a rounded top. The leaves ('needles') are bright green, in clusters of three (two in var. binata), slender, 8 - 15 cm (3.1 - in) long and with a blunt tip. The cones are 7 - 17 cm (2.8 - 6.7 in) long, brown, ovoid (egg-shaped). The bark is fissured and dark grey to brown. It is adapted to cope with stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by the heat of a forest fire; the abundant seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather. Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and Bishop pine (P. muricata) are the tree species most commonly infected by Pitch Canker in California.",

Determining if a tree is a spruce is not difficult; however, specifying which species of Spruce the tree is can be considerably more challenging. In general, trees of this genus can be identified by the four-sided needles and the cones that hang downwards after pollination.",

The shrubs reach 3–5 m (9.8 - 16.5 ft) tall, with alternate, double-toothed hazel-like leaves 2–7 cm (.8 - 2.7 in) long. The flowers are produced in spring, with separate male and female catkins. The fruit form in clusters 3–5 cm (1.1 - 2 in) long with 6-10 seeds; each seed is a small nut 4–6 mm (.04 - .2 in) long, fully enclosed in a sheath-like 'involucre' (i.e. a part of the leaf that's found directly below the flower/seed, and encloses the flower/seed with leaf-like petals).",

The Japanese yew (T. cuspidata) and English yew (T. baccata) grow throughout North America and are widely used as ornamentals. Species in this genus are relatively slow-growing and can be very long-lived. They commonly reach heights of 2.5–20 m (8.2–65.6 ft), with trunk girth averaging 5 m (16 ft).",

The second species is 'Adonidia Dransfieldii' which is native to Borneo and was first described in 2015.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Black Walnut (Juglans nigra) is an ornamental tree in the walnut family Juglandaceae. The enormous tree is identified by its irregular oval crown, pinnately compound leaves, dangling catkins, and clusters of edible nuts. Black walnut trees grow between 100 and 130 ft. (30 – 40 m) and up to 70 ft. (21 m) wide. An identifying feature of a black walnut tree is its thick, dark gray-black bark that develops deep furrows and thin ridges. Looking at pictures of black walnut bark, you’ll notice a distinct diamond-shaped patterning running up the tree trunk. You can also identify a Black Walnut tree by looking closely at the twigs. When the leaves drop, you will see a distinctive three-lobed scar that looks like a shamrock on the branch. Additionally, there will be few, if any, shrubs or small trees growing near a Black Walnut tree.",

This tree is commonly known as the Banyan or the Indian Banyan Fig, and is a tree native to the Indian Subcontinent. Specimens in India are among the largest trees in the world by canopy coverage. It is also known as the 'strangler fig' because it starts out as epiphyte - that is - leaning on another tree that it ends up suffocating. This is accomplished by young plants putting forth roots, which form 'secondary trunks' to support the expansive limbs of the tree. Then these 'secondary trunks' send out more roots until they crowd out (i.e. 'suffocate') the host tree. The leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, and used as animal fodder. This tree produces figs which are popular with birds and monkeys, and also produces flowers which attract wasps for pollination. Older trees can reach more than 200 meters (656 feet) in diameter, with a height of 30 meters (98 feet).",

This particular black walnut is endemic to Northern California and likely has only a few native stands remaining around the SF Bay Area. Native stands are commonly found growing along stream beds, and planted stands have been found throughout Northern and Southern California - and occassionally in Southern Oregon. It is currently threatened by hybridization with other walnut trees (including the Juglans Californica), urbanization, and habitat loss due to agriculture. The nuts of this tree have a smooth, brown, thick shell, that contains a small edible nutmeat. Its pinnately compound leaves tend tend to be shorter in length then the Juglans Californica - and unlike the Southern California Walnut - the vein angles bear tufts of hair.",

Due to its small nutmeat, it isn't grown commercially, however this tree is a great choice for wildlife gardens and especially for attracting birds, which eat the nuts and like to nest in the branches. It has large, pinnately compound leaves with 11-19 lance-shaped leaflets with toothed margins and no hair in the vein angles (unlike the Juglans hindsii).

Plumeria trees are small or low shrubs. The leaves grow at tips of their branches. Their blossoms grow in clusters on ends of the stems, they are made of tubular corolla (i.e. petals are fused together at the base to form a tube-like structure) with a length of 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) that split sharply into five rounded and waxy petals that overlap each other. Their fragrent flowers are commonly used to make leis in Hawaii.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Chestnut Oak (previously called 'Quercus prinus', but now known as 'Quercus montana'), is sometimes called the 'Rock Chestnut Oak'. It is commonly found in the Appalachian region on dry, infertile soils and rocky ridges. It achieves its best growth on rich well-drained soils found near streams. Because of its predominance on steep slopes and dry sites, 'Chestnut oak' has a higher incidence of fire damage and associated decay than other oaks throughout the Appalachians. Notably, it has an inherent resistance to heartwood decay which is greater than that of white, northern red, black, or scarlet oaks. That said, 'Chestnut oak' is still susceptible to most of the diseases that oaks face - including oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) and the twig-blight fungus (Diplodia longispora). It has glossy, dark greenish-yellow leaves that are 4-6 inches (10-15.24 cm) long turn an orange-yellow to yellowish-brown in the fall. It produces acorns that are a deep-toned brown and are favored by many types of wildlife. The bark of the 'Chestnut oak' is particularly distinctive - it is dark brown to black in color with deep ridges.",

This species of oak is endemic to California, and is commonly found in the Coast Ranges and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. It is California's most drought-tolerant deciduous oak. The trees grow slowly, about 12 inches (30 cm) per year. Individual trees over 500 years old have been recorded. The blue-green leaves are tough and leathery - and either have smooth margins or are extremely shallowly lobed. As of 2002, it appears that the Quercus douglasii (and many other members of the white oak group) are resistant to the disease known as 'sudden oak death'. Often a 'Blue Oak' tree will have galls; called “oak apples”. The oak apples are a greyish-red when growing and greyish-black when dead. Immature wasps, inserted into the tree by their mother, cause them. Another kind of gall grows on the leaves, but these are smaller, usually just a spot on the leaf.",

However, the cultivar has one distinct difference - the Callery pear trees produce thorns on new branches, while the Bradford pear variety was originally bred to produce no thorns. The Callery pear tree has been widely planted in many urban areas and unfortunately has seeded out into natural areas and is regarded as invasive in many states.",

Although similar in general appearance to the 'Honey locust' (Gleditsia triacanthos), the 'Black locust' lacks that tree's characteristic long branched thorns on the trunk. Instead, the 'Black locust' features pairs of short prickles at the base of each leaf. The leaves of the Black Locust are composed of 7-20 leaflets, which are oval and rounded and slightly pointed at the ends. The leaflets themselves are not that big (1/2-2 inches long). At nighttime, the leaflets fold up and droop. Because of all the leaflets, the Black Locust has a 'feathery' appearance.",

The leaves are short needles (i.e. 3/4 - 1 1/4 inches or 2–3 cm), and light blue-green. In the fall they turn bright yellow before falling off the branches. The cones are the smallest of any larch, only 3/8 - 7/8 inches (1–2.3 cm) long, with 12-25 seed scales; they are bright red, turning brown and opening to release the seeds when mature (approx. 4 to 6 months after pollination).",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Carya tomentosa (syn. Carya alba), 'Mockernut Hickory' is a large deciduous tree that is native to eastern and central USA. It is the most common hickory species in Virginia and North Carolina. It is a slow growing - but long lived - tree. In the wild, 500 year old trees have been recorded. The species' name comes from the Latin word 'tomentum', meaning 'covered with dense, short hairs' referring to the underside of the leaves, which help identify the species. It is also called the 'White Hickory' due to the light grey-white color of the wood. Its other common name - 'Mockernut' - likely refers to the struggle involved in cracking its thick shell only to find a small, unrewarding nut inside.",

The branches also often bear spines which are flexible and narrow. Leaves are measured at 1.5 - 3 inches (4 - 8 cm) long and are lance-shaped with a short petiole. The fruits are orangish-brown drupes which appear 'berrylike' when ripe and are covered in silvery scales. Each berry contains one large seed, and both the seed and berry case cab be eaten raw or cooked (though the seed case is rather fibrous). In Iran, the dried powder of 'Russian Olive' fruits mixed with milk is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and joint pains.",

The leaves are alternate, simple and remain on the tree until mid-winter. The leaves are 1.25 - 4.75 inches (3–12 cm) long and .75 - 2.25 inches (2–6 cm) broad. The leaves tend to be variable in shape - but they are most commonly shaped like a spatula - being broad and round at the top and narrow and wedged at the base. The margins vary, usually being smooth to shallowly lobed, with a bristle at the apex and lobe tips. The tree is easy to identify by the leaves, which have a lobe that looks as if a drop of water is hanging from the end of the leaf. The tree is adapted to wet, swampy areas, such as along ponds and stream banks, but can also tolerate well-drained sites and even heavy, compacted soils.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Catalpa, commonly called catalpa or catawba, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of North America, the Caribbean, and East Asia. These trees typically grow to 40–60 ft (12–18 m) tall, with branches spreading to a diameter of about 20-40 ft (6–12 m). They have characteristic large, heart-shaped leaves, which in some species are three-lobed. The tree is the sole source of food for the catalpa sphinx moth (Ceratomia catalpae), the leaves being eaten by the caterpillars. When caterpillars are numerous, infested trees may be completely defoliated. Defoliated catalpas produce new leaves readily, but with multiple generations occurring, new foliage may be consumed by subsequent broods. Severe defoliation over several consecutive years can cause death of trees. Because the caterpillars are an excellent live bait for fishing, some dedicated anglers plant catalpa mini-orchards for their own private source of 'catawba-worms', particularly in the southern states. The name derives from the Muscogee name for the tree, 'kutuhlpa' meaning 'winged head' - and is unrelated to the name of the Catawba people (i.e. the Catawba are a federally recognized tribe located in South Carolina, the Muscogee are natively from Tennessee/Alabama/Georgia/and Northern Florida).",
